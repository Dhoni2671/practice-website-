    I was active in academics as well as extracurricular activities, which helped me in developing a well-rounded personality. Academically,
    I always maintained a good record and was amongst the top 10 students of my class. I took a keen interest in subjects like mathematics and science
     and i used to participate in various quizzes and science exhibitions to showcase my knowledge.
    Apart from academics, I was also involved in various co-curricular activities. I was a part of the school debate team and used to represent my school in inter-school debates.
     I also played football for the school team and was the captain in my final year. I learned the importance of teamwork and leadership skills through these activities.
    I was also actively involved in social work and used to volunteer at various events organised by the school. These activities taught me the importance of giving back to society and being empathetic towards others.
    My school life was an amazing journey that taught me several life skills and helped me in becoming a well-rounded individual.
     I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that my school provided me with and will cherish these memories for a lifetime.
    <p class ="title">I Starting the Day<br></p>
I start my day by waking up early, around 6:30 AM, and getting ready for school.
 I have a quick breakfast and then I am on my way to school by 7:30 AM. The start of my day sets the tone for the rest of it, 
 and I make sure I have a positive mindset and am ready to face the challenges ahead.</p>
 <p id ="test"> Favourite Class<br></p>
My favourite class is English. I have always had a love for language and the power it holds to communicate ideas and emotions.
 In my English class, I have the opportunity to delve into literature and express my thoughts through writing and holding discussions with my classmates.</p>
